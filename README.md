# Pet Friendly Community
Like any association, [pet friendly community](https://mypetsprofile.com/business/) have rules, regulations, and restrictions that every homeowner is expected to follow. A communityâ€™s pet policy often details the type of pets allowed in the association, rules for pet owners, and steps taken to ensure compliance.

The building may also have a pet-friendly location, with proximity to a dog park or dog run. While there may not be as much red tape to cut through for apartments that allow pets, you most likely won't find the pet-friendly amenities.
